# Weather-Prediction-MLNN
#### Given weather in Szeged 2006-2016, a Python program that detects the humidity using MLNN.

### repository contains two programs 
* MLNN implementation from scratch.
* MLNN implementation using SKlearn

### The tasks I went through it during the development process of the MLNN

* Performing all necessary preprocessing for the dataset.
* determining the MLNN architecture.
* Update the weights using batch learning algorithm, using 10 epochs each of randomly selected 10 training patterns from the training set (70 % of the dataset). 
* computing the MSE(mean squared error)on the test set after each epoch.
* drawing a chart with a horizontal axis “Epoch number” ranging from 1 to 10, and a vertical axis “MSE”.
