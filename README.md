# Weather-Prediction-MLNN
#### Given weather in Szeged 2006-2016, a Python program that detects the humidity using MLNN.

## repository contains two programs 
item MLNN implementation from scratch.
item MLNN implementation using SKlearn

## The tasks I went through it during the development process of the MLNN

item Performing all necessary preprocessing for the dataset.
item determining the MLNN architecture.
item Update the weights using batch learning algorithm, using 10 epochs each of randomly selected 10 training patterns from the training set (70 % of the dataset). 
item computing the MSE(mean squared error)on the test set after each epoch.
item drawing a chart with a horizontal axis “Epoch number” ranging from 1 to 10, and a vertical axis “MSE”.
